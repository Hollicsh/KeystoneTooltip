This is a small addon that adds information about the loot one can acquire from completing a keystone.

It provides the keystone's:

* minimum available item level upon completion.
* weekly chest reward item level.

This addon was originally called [MythicPlusLoot by Artanisx](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mythicplusloot).

Credit goes to them, I merely updated it and added Residuum amounts.
